Filtering out Moulvibazar S. upazilla from Bangladesh administrative area, I then selected some landcovers geometry points from the upazilla and merge all the the geometry points(featureCollection). After that I filtered out the sentinel 2 imagery as my need with specific bands. Using the sampleRegions and smileCart, I trained the data. Then using classify method I did the supervised classification. Here are the [GEE code link](https://code.earthengine.google.com/2c3968fbcbea558c2f09f4b801641e03), 
      [snapshot of land cover classification](https://github.com/AtikulRahi/supervisedClassification/blob/main/LandCoverClassification.JPG),     [Geotiff file](https://github.com/AtikulRahi/supervisedClassification/blob/main/LandCoverClassification.tif), [The code](https://github.com/AtikulRahi/supervisedClassification/blob/main/supervisedClassification.js).
